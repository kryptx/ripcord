A JSON-RPC API implementing a traditional style of adventure game.

## What is this?
It's a side project. It's an experiment. It's also playtime and a little bit of dress rehearsal.

Since RPC has fallen so far out of favor (thanks to REST), I wanted to imagine what a user-friendly, clean developed RPC-over-HTTP API might realistically look like, from the ground up.

For that purpose, I'll introduce an entity -- a player character -- to which the user can issue commands. Much like the classic game, Adventure.

The API meets the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification. It currently does _nothing of value_.

## How do I play?
You don't, until I decide to implement this somehow.
